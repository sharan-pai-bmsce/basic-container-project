Throughout, it is the music that takes center stage, with the jigsaw of Mozart's life fitting around it. With rigorous analysis from musicologists and experts such as Jonathan Miller, Cliff Eisen, Nicholas Till, Bayan Northcott and the late Stanley Sadie, a new, vivid impression of the composer emerges. It dispels the many common myths about Mozart's genius, health, relationships, death and character, to present a new image, very different from Milos Forman's 'Amadeus'.",

The film adopts an innovative structure by interspersing documentary footage and interviews with dramatizations of these different versions of Turner\u2019s story. A unique collaboration between MacArthur Genius Award feature director Charles Burnett, acclaimed historian of slavery Kenneth S. Greenberg and Academy Award-nominated documentary producer Frank Christopher, Nat Turner is a compelling look at one of history\u2019s most mysterious figures.",

In the show, classic dishes such as pot roast, fried okra, fried chicken and pecan pie were the norm, and overly complicated or eccentric recipes were usually eschewed. Dishes that are flavorful and familiar were spotlighted, although the fat content and calorie count of the meals were often very high. Paula also showed off vignettes of Savannah, Georgia, where she co-owns with her sons Jamie and Bobby, The Lady & Sons.\r\n\r\nDeen's popularity, spurred by the show, led to a small role in the feature film Elizabethtown.\r\n\r\nDespite its seemingly Southern atmosphere, Paula's Home Cooking was taped in upstate New York until 2006; since then, shows had been taped at Deen's new home near Savannah. In 2008, Deen began work on a revamped version of the series called Paula's Best Dishes, in which friends and family join her in the kitchen to prepare recipes. Deen's sons often appeared as guests on the show. They too proved to be popular among Food Network's audience and now have their own show, Road Tasted, similar to Rachael Ray's Tasty Travels. Deen's husband, Michael Groover, also appeared sporadically as a guest, and Food Network taped the Deen-Groover wedding in 2004 as a special edition of the show. The success of Paula's Home Cooking led to a line of cookbooks, a magazine, other television shows and specials, and related merchandise. Reruns of the show now air on Food Network's sister channel GAC.",

It was erudite and sophisticated. It was physical and ridiculous. It was horrifying. It was hilarious.\" Crowe stormed the Edinburgh Fringe Festival with five star reviews and agglomerations of madding fans. He's won the Seattle and San Francisco comedy competitions, and has numerous appearances on Comedy Central and The Bob & Tom Radio Show. \"Crooked Finger\" was taped at the Triple Door Theater in downtown Seattle. It includes topical and some wild material that didn't air on his Showtime Comedy Special. See the show that the Herald called \"a lethal comedy whiplash.\"",

Chief Inspector Antonio Lazzaro returns from fighting the drug cartels of Latin America to take charge of the homicide squad. Complicating matters is a romantic relationship that's not quite over between him and fellow inspector Simona Colli. While keeping their relationship professional the couple, along with their crack investigative team, solve a series of murders that seem unrelated - until a pattern emerges. The murderer leaves cryptic clues from Dante's Divine Comedy at each crime scene. Veiled language from the medieval classic points to the next victim or the next crime location, luring the investigators ever deeper into a mystery, a trap and the mind of a killer. Lazzaro is soon racing against time to catch the maniacal killer whose ultimate target is Lazzaro himself. The ancient meets the modern as the homicide squad scrambles to use the latest forensic technology as well as their own instincts to find the Dante Killer before he closes in on them all. Yet all their training and methodology are of no use to them when it comes to unlocking the inner workings of the mind of an obsessed lunatic. Starring Massimo Ghini, Luisa Ranieri (Letters to Juliet) and Omero Antonutti (The Night of The Shooting Stars), this thrilling six-part series on three DVDs from acclaimed screenwriter Sandro Petraglia explores some of life's biggest issues: the nature of good and evil, love, obsession and the criminal mind.",

Fortunately, six months prior to the 2004 election, documentary filmmaker Marc Berlin discovered someone who did know these things: Vernon Craig. Distantly related to the Bush's, and victim of a Dubya sucker-punch outside a New Haven bar in 1968, Craig agreed to be interviewed about his extensive knowledge of, and connection to, the Bush-Walker dynasty. Guiding us to those elite places and institutions which played a role in forming George W.'s right-wing politics--from the sprawling Walker estate in Kennebunkport to Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts and finally the ivied walls of Yale University and Skull and Bones--Vernon Craig, \"The Man Who Knew Bush\", wryly explains what George W.

To aid in the endeavor, Paris enlists the help of Maya Gibbs, an African American prostitute versed not only in the language of the street, but also in the words of Maya Angelou and Nadine Gordimer. And together, the path of this dysfunctional duo crosses with those of the child's parents, a doctor with a penchant for soliciting \"Street Boys\", a self-ascribed King Of Porn, a drug supplier with a gift for making impeccable hors d'oeuvres, and a hardened cop with more scams than the most adept street hustler.",

It is a story that has left many questions unanswered, and the programme provides an intriguing hypothesis that the ship that plummeted two miles to the bottom of the sea was not the Titanic but its sister ship the Olympic.  This film is based upon the research of Andrew Newton and includes the evidence of the British and American inquiries, the eye witness reports of survivors, newspapers of the day, photographs, video, film and radio broadcasts.  The views and opinions presented in this film are based on actual evidence and legitimate inference.  It may be the ultimate conspiracy \u2013 or could it be the truth?",

Expatriate Kiwi sexologist Dr John Money of the world renowned Johns Hopkins Medical School believed that gender was the product of \u201cnurture not nature.\u201d His studies into intersex people led to a particular surgical treatment model for babies born with ambiguous genitalia \u2013 the idea being that doctors could produce healthy and happy men and women by intervening early in an intersex child\u2019s life. Usually that meant a family secret that had to be kept at all costs.  But as the film shows, human sexual development is never that straight forward. This is a heart-warming story told with a mix of laughter and tears in the most frank and revealing way.",

He is in a live-in relationship with his love Geetali, a sound designer by profession. Eric, an Anthropology PhD student from US and Parth come together to make a film on the traditional Maharashtrian religious pilgrimage journey of 'WAARI'. It was Parth's dream to make a path-breaking international film on Waari wherein millions of devotees walk together for 250 kms in 18 days to meet their beloved lord Vithoba. Parth undertakes the challenge to capture this eventful journey of millions, with the core thoughts behind it, in a contemporary manner. He and his team, work very hard to capture the grandeur and soul of Waari. The 18 Chapters of the Dnyaneshwari (a household religious book followed by Warkaris as a key to bliss and happy living) unfold very interestingly with real life characters in the pilgrimage.",

Told through the firsthand accounts of four survivors--Toivi Blatt, Phillip Bialowitz, Selma Engel-Wijnberg, and former Russian POW Semjon Rozenfeld--and using dramatic reenactments, Escape From a Nazi Death Camp recounts the true horror of life at Sobibor, and the desperation, determination, and courage of its prisoners. Of the 600 inmates present on the day of the escape, 300 escaped into the forest surrounding Sobibor. Of that 300, many were shot, turned in, murdered, or captured by Nazis. Around 50 survived the war and of that 50, only a handful are still alive.

The prairie was a place of constant motion, shaped by an unforgiving cycle of the seasons. Huge numbers of bison, elk, pronghorn, deer, prairie dogs, prairie wolves and even grizzlies were common. There were massive migrations of birds and fish. But as America grew, and the land was settled and tamed, the wildness began disappearing. Today the Great Plains is a fragile and threatened ecosystem, home to a variety of wildlife and habitats. In this documentary, Forsberg examines the wildlife and native landscapes that remain, exploring the current condition of the plains.",

But evidence confirms she existed, one of over 1,000 women soldiers who served in the Civil War. What made her so dangerous she was erased from history?",

Ikoma, a boy who lives in the Aragane station and helps to build Hayajiro, creates his own weapon called Tsuranukizutsu in order to defeat the creatures. One day, as he waits for an opportunity to use his weapon, he meets a girl named Mumei, who is excused from the mandatory Kabane inspection. During the night, Ikuma meets Mumei again as he sees Hayajiro going out of control. The staff on the locomotive has turned into the creatures. The station, now under attack by Kabane, is the opportunity Ikoma has been looking for.",

Now, her parents and those who knew her reassemble the pieces of Parsons\u2019s life in their courageous quest to make accountable the systems that failed to protect her. With the support of Anonymous, an online campaign and public pressure, they forced the Nova Scotian government and RCMP to address the case and bring the perpetrators to justice.

Born on the threshold of America's burgeoning industrial empire, Edison's curiosity led him to its cutting edge.

Driven and intensely competitive, Edison was often neglectful in his private life and could be ruthless in business. Challenged by competition in the industry he'd founded, Edison launched an ugly propaganda campaign against his rivals, and used his credibility as an electrical expert to help ensure that high-voltage electrocution became a form of capital punishment.",

Cameras follow two prides and their respective females by day and by night, revealing astonishing behavioral patterns of Africa's largest lions. Symbols of courage and power, lions have been intensively researched for many decades. While hardly a single facet of their lives has gone unnoticed, certain things have remained hidden. Thanks to thermal imaging cameras, this two-part series reveals the last secrets of Africa's largest wild cats. We follow two prides in Southern Kenya and their respective females by day and by night, discovering astonishing behavioral patterns. Lean times face the animals as the huge wildebeest herds, which, until now have supplied the young families with ample food, are migrating south to the Serengeti. We will watch the daily struggle for survival as these mothers risk everything in order to rear their young. Protecting their youngsters from threats such as pythons, African buffalo, and elephants. However, it is the other lions that are the greatest threat. We will observe as the fate of the young lions is decided during the next few weeks and when a group of young male lions arrives with ambitions of wresting the territory from its current rulers, the situation escalates in this dramatic family saga.",

Santiago is a 55-year-old independent producer who is about to make a film (with scarce funds) about Cura Brochero's life. Luciano is a 40-year-old actor who leads a miserable, hectic life marked by excesses and weaknesses. Their stories get intermingled when Luciano accepts, out of necessity, a proposal to take part in this movie project and is asked to play Cura Jos\u00e9 Gabriel Brochero. As the film develops, the life and personal examples of Brochero, The Cura Gaucho, will constantly exhort Luciano's current lifestyle and mindset to be revised, which leads to a crisis in his innermost nature that will force him to reconsider several aspects of his life. At the end of the movie, Luciano decides to take up the Spiritual Exercises recommended by Brochero as a means to change a person's life. The film, produced by Maranatha Civil Association, is a fiction movie that thoroughly narrates The Cura Gaucho's life resorting to Luciano and Santiago's stories. Through this \"film within a film\", the producer clearly shows us how the ideals and human values of great men like Brochero can transform and improve our lives.",

The robot lands and does some exploring of his own, gulping up rock samples and photographing the Cat, Nick, Sally, and Fish before blasting off back into space. What was that thing? Where did it come from? Where is it going? The Cat in the Hat fires up his Space-ama-racer and whisks Nick, Sally and Fish off on a cosmic adventure in search of the robot. Together, they survive a dust storm on the surface of Mars, rocket through an asteroid belt, and then narrowly escape being sucked into Jupiter by its huge gravitational pull. Ultimately, they hitch a ride on a comet that leads them all safely back to the Space Station, along with plenty of space samples, and stories and even a small souvenir that follows The Cat in the Hat and our crew back to Earth.",

Why was he fired as General of the Third Army and relegated to a governorship of post-war Bavaria? Who were his enemies? Was he a threat to Eisenhower, Montgomery, Churchill, and Bradley? And is it possible as some say that the General's freakish collision with an Army truck, on the day before his departure for US, was not really an accident? Or was Patton not only dismissed by his peers, but the victim of an assassin's bullet at their behest? Was his personal silence necessary?",

The idea of humans participating in an alien hybrid program sounds absurd until you talk to people who have experienced it. Thousands of women and men around the world have had reproductive experiments carried out against their will. The most harrowing? Unexplained pregnancies that terminate without explanation. In many cases, the memories of what happened remain suppressed and fragmented, leaving experiencers confused, depressed and with a profound sense of loss. In others, the memories are visceral and emotionally disturbing. Thanks to increased public acceptance and regression therapy, more and more people are coming forward with stories of abductions and strange fertilization procedures that occur during their frightening experiences. Are aliens involved in a complex hybridization project where human females are used as vessels to carry hybrid fetuses and human males have their sperm harvested until they're ready to be transferred \"elsewhere?\" And if so, to what end? \"Extraordinary: The Seeding\" is a riveting documentary that tells these stories through one-on-one interviews with abductees-brave individuals willing to share intensely personal and emotional stories with the rest of the world. Through analysis with global ufology experts, the film also explores hybridization, why it's happening and what the impact on humanity is and will be. The information presented is intended to educate, entertain and encourage audiences to ask one simple question: What if this is all true?",

To further complicate the daily rigors of teenage life, her father, Robert, an advertising executive who has since rebuilt his business, tries to do the same with his relationship with his daughter. Against his therapist's advice, overeager Robert tries really hard to get close to Tennie by showing his own way of caring. He tries to find out about his daughter's personal life with the help of his newly appointed, 19 year-old driver/intern, Jack. Practically being raised by her extended family, Tennie although very academically inclined and mature for her age, with compassion for others, she's got a touch of sarcasm, and a hint of rebelliousness. After she catches on to her father's plan, Tennie realizes that in order to get her father off of her back, she needs to convince him to find a lady friend. She recruits her friends to create an online dating profile in order to introduce her father to potential companions. Little did she know that her father already was seeing someone that he was not yet ready to introduce to her. Things escalate when Robert gets Tennie's friends from school to participate in a focus group for a project, and in retaliation, Tennie throws a party at the house with almost half of the school showing up. A series of hilarious interactions between father and daughter ensues that starts to close the generational gap between them. What finally brings them together is a long overdue heart to heart conversation about past transgressions. One thing becomes certain, they will always have each other.",

Described as hilarious, complex, stupid, irritating (and 'sardonic' by one lady in Goa) the show veers in and out of the familiar and the bizarre with equal comfort. A knee-slapping head-scratching torrent of jokes, characters and self-aware comedy that successfully spent the entire budget that was available to spend on the show. Featuring six very silly live sketches, stitched together by a much sillier story about the nature of art itself and bookended by extremely silly and unnecessary opening and closing, Sketchy Behaviour is truly a work of something.",

The hosts keep a close eye on those who laugh, chuckle, or even smile. Each comedian performs a \"SHOWTIME\" with the undivided attention of the other contestants for three minutes. Playing to their strengths won't be enough. These 10 comedians will need to experiment outside their comfort zones if they hope to make their competition crack in this 6 hour long comedy face-off.
